Didn't use user verification when in the register path. After a successful registration set the tokens to the browser cookies as logged in that time.  

Used one exception type as CustomException by including a custom Error code and a message.

Used Spring's caching mechanism (in-memory), because don't need a distributed one here hence this is a single instance of a monolith application. 

Didn't use the Lombok. because my IDE has a issue with Lombok (an Annotation processing issue)

Some API couldn't be tested due to time constraints

Added almost all the crud and other operations

Had to create seperate entity. because need to have borrow records for users and books.
